 * different stages.

// === REUSED CODE =========================================

/**
 * the Scroller encapsulates the I/O related to scrolling.
 * it captures keyboard events for the (j) and (k) keys,
 * keeps track of the scroll state, and provides a function
 * that renders the scrolled content.
 *
 * Because Scroller is stateful, each Stage that uses it
 * creates its own Scroller instance. The effect of this is
 * that scroll state does not persist between Stages. If you
 * navigate to a Stage, scroll, and navigate away, your
 * scroll position is not saved.

 * The scrollablePage renderer uses the view function
 * returned by Scroller to render the content.
 *
 * In a more complex situation where only part of the

 * lines to render. Then the renderer could insert the lines
